# üì± ESP32 Bluetooth Device Tracker

This project scans for nearby Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices using the ESP32's built-in Bluetooth capabilities. It displays device names, signal strength (RSSI), and estimated distances, providing real-time tracking of BLE devices in the vicinity.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Scans for nearby Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices
- Displays the following for each device:
  - **Device Name** ‚Äì BLE device name (or "Unknown" if not available)
  - **RSSI** ‚Äì Signal strength in dBm
  - **Distance** ‚Äì Estimated distance based on signal strength
- Active scanning for more accurate RSSI readings
- Automatic scanning every 5 seconds
- 4-second scan duration per cycle
- Clean, formatted output with fixed-width columns

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About BLE Scanning and Distance Estimation

- **BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)** is a wireless technology for short-range communication.
- **RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator)** measures the power level of received signals.
- **Distance Estimation** is based on RSSI values:
  - **<1m** ‚Äì Very close (RSSI > -50 dBm)
  - **1-3m** ‚Äì Close proximity (RSSI -50 to -65 dBm)
  - **3-10m** ‚Äì Medium range (RSSI -65 to -80 dBm)
  - **10-20m** ‚Äì Long range (RSSI -80 to -95 dBm)
  - **>20m** ‚Äì Very far (RSSI < -95 dBm)

**Note:** Distance estimation is approximate and can be affected by:
- Physical obstacles (walls, furniture)
- Device orientation
- Environmental interference
- Device power settings
