## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About the ESP32 Hall Effect Sensor

- The ESP32 has a **built-in Hall effect sensor** that can detect magnetic fields.
- The sensor works by measuring the **voltage difference** between two ADC channels (ADC1_CHANNEL_0 and ADC1_CHANNEL_3).
- **Calibration:** The sensor automatically calibrates on startup to establish a baseline reading in the current environment.
- **Detection Thresholds:**
  - **Detection Threshold:** 100 (sensitive detection)
  - **Strong Threshold:** 500 (strong field detection)
- **How it works:** When a magnet approaches the ESP32, the Hall effect sensor detects the magnetic field and produces a voltage change that is converted to a digital reading.
